# Oyo Cancellation Data_analysis
(dummy dataset)
## This project aims to analyze OYO Hotels and Resorts data using Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn and Numpy libraries.

<br/>


## Business Problem
#### In recent years, OYO hotels (City Hotel and Resort Hotel) have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less-than-ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.
#### We will be analysing the problem by performing Data Analysis and will suggest possible solutions.Â¶

## Process Undertaken
#### 1. Cleaned the Dataset by removing null values and removing columns that were not needed
#### 2. Performed exploratory Data Analysis.
#### 3. Did Data Analysis and Visualisation to figure out the reason behind the problem stated.
#### 4. Made bar charts, Pie-charts, Histograms and line charts.



<br/>


## Suggestions provided after Analysis:
#### 1. Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, OYO could work on its pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. #### They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
#### 2. As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the hotel is higher in the resort hotel than in the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.
#### 3. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.
#### 4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
